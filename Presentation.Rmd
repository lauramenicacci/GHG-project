# Research interest and outlook  

.pull-left[
* We are interested in investigating the two most prominent methods for accounting greenhous gas emissions
* Currently, the allocation of responsibility is based on the production-based (PB) accounting method
* Many scholars promote an alternative accounting method as complementary: the consumption-based (CB) one. 

*WHY?* 
--
* In this presentation, we will focus on the differences between these two methods, analyse trends and implications and understand why it is important to have different perspectives when accounting for greenhouse gases

HINT: it has to do with responsibility!

# Useful definitions

## Production-based accounting


* Measures emissions generated in the place where goods and services are produced
* Official accounting system used under the UNFCCC Framework
* Calculates emissions that are generated from the domestic production of goods and services irrespective of whether they are consumed domestically or are exported
* Sometimes called 'territorial'



## Consumption-based accounting

* Measures emissions produced by the final consumption of goods and services
* It is calculated by adding to production-based accounting (PBA) emissions generated to produce
imported goods and services and subtracting those associated with exported goods and services 
* PBE + Emissions (Import) - Emissions (Export)
* Accounts for **trade**

# Consumption-based accounting is relevant

## Lifestyles and globalisation

* In a globalised world, the transfer of carbon between regions, either physically or embodied in production, represents a substantial fraction of global carbon emissions.

* Emissions produced by international trade are constantly increasing 

* There are **emission importing** and **emission exporting** countries

# Trends and differences

Production-based emissions are wayyyy more!
