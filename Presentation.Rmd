# Research interest and outlook  

.pull-left[
* We are interested in investigating the two most prominent methods for accounting greenhous gas emissions
* Currently, the allocation of responsibility is based on the production-based (PB) accounting method
* Many scholars promote an alternative accounting method as complementary: the consumption-based (CB) one. 

*WHY?* 
--
* In this presentation, we will focus on the differences between these two methods, analyse trends and implications and understand why it is important to have different perspectives when accounting for greenhouse gases

HINT: it has to do with responsibility!

# Useful definitions

## Production-based accounting


* Measures emissions generated in the place where goods and services are produced
* Official accounting system used under the UNFCCC Framework
* Calculates emissions that are generated from the domestic production of goods and services irrespective of whether they are consumed domestically or are exported
* Sometimes called 'territorial'



## Consumption-based accounting

* Measures emissions produced by the final consumption of goods and services
* It is calculated by adding to production-based accounting (PBA) emissions generated to produce
imported goods and services and subtracting those associated with exported goods and services 
* CBE = PBE + Emissions (Import) - Emissions (Export)
* Accounts for **trade**

# Consumption-based accounting is relevant

## Lifestyles and globalisation

* In a globalised world, the transfer of carbon between regions, either physically or embodied in production, represents a substantial fraction of global carbon emissions.

*  20–25% of overall carbon dioxide emissions are from the production of internationally traded products

* There are **emission importing** and **emission exporting** countries

# Implications of accounting for trade

.pull-left-center[
## Equity and justice benefits

- Adopting a PB accounting approach implies that developed countries do not in reality face up to their historical responsibility. 

- A CB approach would free a larger slice of the carbon budget to the developing world.

## Carbon leakage 

- Possibility to deal with strong and weak ‘carbon leakage

## Larger coverage of emissions

- As it could resolve for accounting of emissions from aviation and bunker fuels

# Limitations of a consumption-based approach

.pull-left[
- **Effectiveness/efficiency concerns**: including the consumer-side in the policy creation process could result on more harm than good. CB accounting does not necessarily provide a direct link between a country’s actions and changes in emissions. 

- **Practical impediments**: an established system for compiling national emissions inventories through a CB approach has not been implemented yet. 

- **Political incompatibility**: will developed countries accept liability for emissions they have no control over?

# Conclusion and discussion

---
# To sum up

1. A general trend is that developed countries are emission importers, while developing countries are emission exporters

2. For this reason, when accounting for production-based emissions, developed countries seem to have less responsibility. 

3. However, consumption-based accounting allows for more emission covering

4. By including international trade in the equation, developing countries have **less responsibility when it comes to mitigation policies**

## Discussion

- Given what you listened today, could you see a role for CB accounting in the international climate policy scenario? If yes, how? 

- Could you imagine examples of consumption-based policies? 

- Do you have any suggestions for further research into this topic?

## Thanks for listening!!
