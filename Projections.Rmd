##Read in and prepare data

```{r}
ener_data <- read_excel("data/ener-data.xlsx", sheet = "4. CO2 EMISSIONS")

#get dataframe with projections of co2 emissions in mega tonnes
ener_data1 <- ener_data %>%
  na.omit() %>% 
  filter(!row_number() %in% c(1, 2, 3, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56))

ener_data1 <- ener_data1 %>% select(-2)

#rename columns
ener_data1 <- ener_data1 %>% 
  rename("Region" = 1, "Unit" = 2, "2000" = 3, "2005" = 4, "2010" = 5, "2015" = 6, "2020" = 7, "2025" = 8, "2030" = 9, "2035" = 10, "2040" = 11, "2045" = 12, "2050" = 13, "Change in %/year" = 14)
  
#create year variable
ener_data1 <- ener_data1 %>% 
  pivot_longer("2000":"2050", names_to = "Year")
```

##Bring in consumption based accounting and calculate own projections

```{r}
