# Production versus consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions. Data analysis on the implications of responsibility perspective

On this page you can find our analysis of data that we conduted for the final project for a second year Hertie School elective Data Perspectives on GHG emissions.

The aim of our paper was to describe and review the differences in emission trends when looking at both production and consumption-based accounting schemes.

Furthermore, a particular interest was placed in evaluating whether a switch from production- to consumption-based accounting would make a difference in efforts and their distribution in meeting climate change mitigation targets, with implications on just and effective climate policies, including the future carbon budget allocation. 

The paper has been structured as follows. The first part deals with the review of existing literature and describe definitions that will be used in the paper. The second part describes the possible limitations of the present approach in answering the research question. The third part is an empirical analysis of trends and patterns of countries and regions of interest using data from Our World in Data based on Friedlingstein et al. (2022), checking if our results are in line with the existing literature. The fourth part is an empirical analysis of future emissions projections using data from the company Enerdata. The last part provides an evaluation and conclusions on the policy implications of using a carbon-based accounting approach for international trade and climate policy fields.
